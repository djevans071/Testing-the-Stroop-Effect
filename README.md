# Testing the Stroop Effect

The [Stroop Effect][1] is a psychological phenomenon that identifies stimuli that may interfere with the reaction time of a given task. The psychological test that observes this effect is called the **Stroop test**, whose results were [first published in English in 1935 by J. Ridley Stroop][2]. 

Test subjects are given two different lists of words with: 
 * colored text corresponding to the words they describe. These are *congruent* lists.
 * colored text not corresponding to the words they describe. These are *incongruent* lists.

Participants are required to identify the *color* of the words, not the text. This becomes especially important for identifying colors in the incongruent list. In this project, we will be examining the time it takes to identify colors in equally-sized lists of each type, and see if they differ significantly enough for us to conclude that a real effect is occuring. We do this by performing a statistical test to a sample of experimental data to determine significance.
